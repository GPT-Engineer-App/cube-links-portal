# cube-links-portal

hey devin i am looking to create a landing page in the browser similar to a page you would see when you are logging into a SAML SSO provider where you have all the SAML SSO apps available to you. I would like to have the ability to edit the number of links. I would like the links to be cube with a nice looking ui and edges. It needs to be responsive to respond to the page and screen size. and I need to have the ability to update the links( and add links) and in the links and with a cube i would like it to have a preview of what the website looks like. I need to be able to have different endpoints for different departments and be able to not have a login to view these I just want you to be able to view them. I want this to be able to replace bookmarks for someone, think of this as company resource links.
